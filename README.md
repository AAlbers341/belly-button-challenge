## Purpose
The Belly Button Biodiversity dashboard explores the microbes that colonize human navels. The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species, also called operational taxonomic units (OTUs), were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

## Dependencies
- D3 Library
- Plotly
- Bootstrap

## Top 10 Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs)
The bar chart represents the top 10 OTUs found in the selected test subject ID. The x-axis represents the top 10 OTUs while the y-axis represents sample values. Hover over the individual bars to see the individual OTU labels.

## Demographic Info
The demographic info represents the following metadata associated with the selected test subject ID:
- ID
- Ethnicity
- Gender
- Age
- Location
- BBType

## Bubble Chart
The bubble chart represents the OTU IDs and their associated value count. Using the sample values for each ID, we can see the spread of OTU IDs that have frequented the most values from the selected test subject chosen from the dropdown.
